## Dumbpad Vial Source v1.01
- These are the `/keymap` files neccesary to compile your own Vial build of the firmware.
- You will require both the QMK and Vial build environments set up on your system.
- You will also have to modify the root config.h to match the vendor and product ID of the files here to compile correctly.
